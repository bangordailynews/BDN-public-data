### Your School project school-level data

These files compile data from the Maine Department of Education's Data Warehouse into one location and include a field to group schools that merged during the period 2007 to 2017. 

The file links a range of data points to individual schools, with rows for each year the DOE recorded that measure. Some pertain only to high schools, such as graduation and college-going rates. 

The files also contain identifying data for the schools, based partly on the [Maine DOE's Open and Closed School Report](https://neo.maine.gov/DOE/neo/Supersearch/ContactSearch/SearchByOpenAndClosedSchools). We geocoded the addresses and added a descriptive field identifying whether the school is closed or set to close, or open indefinitely. 

The file includes data by school for annual enrollment, annual classroom teacher totals, the average classroom teacher age, the number and share of classroom teachers with master's degrees, the average years of teacher experience, the number and share of students qualifying for free or reduced-price lunch, the number and share of students in special education, dropout and graduation rates, and college-going rates. 

The data also includes more detail on college-going rates, identifying the numbers of students going to two- or four-year schools and breaking those totals down also by public and private institutions. 

### Bonus district spending data

This repository also includes district-level data on school spending by category. The spending data is unavailable at the individual school level.
