Leadership PAC contributions were taken [directly from Maine Ethics Commission contribution files](http://mainecampaignfinance.com/PublicSite/DataDownload.aspx) for the decade 2008-2018. 

The contribution files were joined with data on the candidate's current campaigns, including their party affiliations, financing type and more, also from the Maine Ethics Commission. Ballot qualification status was referenced from the [Maine Secretary of State's Office](http://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/upcoming/index.html).
